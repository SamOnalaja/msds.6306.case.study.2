# MSDS6306 Case Study 2 - Background

DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 1000 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business green lights the project, they have tasked your data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data.


## About Research Data

Our team is assigned to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine factors that lead to attrition. 
    1. Identify at least the top three factors that contribute to turnover.
    2. Ceate derived attributes/variables.
    3. Identify any job role specific trends that may exist in the data set (e.g., “Data Scientists have the highest job satisfaction”). 
    4. Identify any other interesting trends and observations from the analysis. 
    
Each of the analysis should be backed up by robust experimentation and where applicable, the appropriate visualization.
